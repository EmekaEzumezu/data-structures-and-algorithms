Task0: 
The time complexity is O(1), which is the time complexity of accessing an element of an array.

Task1: 
The time complexity is O(n) since we and adding the unique elements of the arrays.

Task2: 
The time complexity is O(n) since we access all the calls and add up their times.

Task3: 
The time complexity is O(n log n). We accessed the calls which have a time complexity of O(n) and also performed a sorting operation that has a time complexity of O(n log n). O(n) + O(n log n) can simply be put to be O(n log n).

Task4: 
The time complexity is O(n log n), we iterated through the calls which have a time complexity of O(n) and also performed a sorting operation which has a time complexity of O(n log n). O(n) + O(n log n) can simply be put to be O(n log n).
